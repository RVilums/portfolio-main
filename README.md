# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built using React and SCSS. It showcases my skills, projects, and experience. The website is designed to be easily expandable, allowing for the addition of new features and packages in the future.

## Features

- **React**: The website is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **SCSS**: Styling is done using SCSS, a powerful CSS preprocessor that extends the capabilities of CSS.
- **React Router Dom v6**: The website uses React Router Dom v6 to handle routing and navigation.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/portfolio-website.git
   \`\`\`

2. Change into the project directory:

   \`\`\`bash
   cd portfolio-website
   \`\`\`

3. Install the required dependencies:

   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`

4. Start the development server:

   \`\`\`bash
   npm start
   \`\`\`

   This will start the development server and open the website in your default browser.

## Adding Additional Packages

If you want to add new packages to the project, such as Framer Motion or other useful packages, follow these steps:

1. Install the desired package using npm or yarn:

   \`\`\`bash
   npm install package-name
   \`\`\`

2. Import the package in the necessary components or files:

   \`\`\`jsx
   import { PackageComponent } from 'package-name';
   \`\`\`

   Use the imported components or functions as required in your code.

## Folder Structure

The project's folder structure is organized as follows:

\`\`\`
portfolio-website/
├── src/
│ ├── components/ # React components
│ ├── styles/ # SCSS styles
│ ├── App.js # Main application component
│ ├── index.js # Entry point of the application
│ └── ...
├── public/
│ ├── index.html # HTML template
│ └── ...
├── package.json # Project dependencies and scripts
├── README.md # Project documentation (you're reading it!)
└── ...
\`\`\`

## Customizing the Website

To customize the content of the website and make it your own, you can modify the components and styles present in the project. The \`src/components\` directory contains reusable React components, while the \`src/styles\` directory contains SCSS styles for the website.

Feel free to update the components, styles, and content to suit your needs and preferences.

## Deployment

To deploy the website to a hosting platform of your choice, follow the deployment instructions provided by the platform. Typically, you would build the project using the following command:

\`\`\`bash
npm run build
\`\`\`

This will create an optimized production build of the website in the \`build\` directory. You can then upload the contents of the \`build\` directory to your hosting platform.
